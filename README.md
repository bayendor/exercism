[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/bayendor/exercism/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/bayendor/exercism)

The purpose of exercism is to:
==============================

practice writing expressive code.
practice accepting feedback graciously.
practice giving feedback respectfully.

One particularly well-kept secret is that looking at someone's code with an eye towards finding 
ways of improving it can teach you more about writing readable code than receiving feedback on your own code.

Doing this forces you to think about why you make the trade-offs that you do, what in the code you are 
reacting to, and why you are reacting to it.

Your voice will make the conversation more interesting. If the same 3 people are always providing the same
feedback, then their ideas and style might overpower other, perhaps better, ideas.
